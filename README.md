# Welcome to The Squad! üëãüèª

We are a group of passionate software engineers who are interested in building scalable and robust software systems.

Our mission is to simulate a microservices architecture e-commerce app.

Let's get started! and have a look at what we are trying to build! üéâ.

# E-Commerce Microservices Platform

we are simulating building an e-commerce platform using microservices architecture. We are building a platform that allows customers to browse products, add them to their cart, and purchase them. We are also building a platform that allows admins to manage products, categories, brands, stores, stocks and coupons.

## 1. Order Service
The Orders API microservice is an important component of our e-commerce platform, designed to efficiently handle the creation, management, and processing of our customers' orders. And it encapsulates order-related functionalities.

Check out the full details here üëâüèª [Order Service API README file.](https://github.com/Fawry-Project/Order-Service-API)

and here is the ERD for the database used in this service:

```mermaid
erDiagram
ORDER ||--o{ ORDER_ITEM : "consists of"
ORDER{
    int id pk
    string coupon_code 
    string order_code
    string user_email
    double total_price
    double total_price_after_discount
    date creation_date
}

ORDER_ITEM{
    int id pk
    int order_id fk
    int product_code
    int quntity
}
```

## 2. Notification Service
The notification service is a Spring Boot application designed to handle notifications through email. It integrates with a Kafka topic to consume notification requests from an external source, processes these requests, and sends emails using JavaMailSender. Additionally, it features a retry mechanism to handle failed email delivery attempts, ensuring robustness and reliability in delivering notifications.

Check out the full details here üëâüèª [Notification Service API README file.](https://github.com/Fawry-Project/notification-service-api)

and here is the ERD for the database used in this service:

```mermaid
erDiagram
notification{
    int id pk
    string destination
    string content
    date sent_at
    string subject
    string status(SENT-FAILED-RETRY_FAILED)
    int retry_amount
}
```

## 3. Product Catalog API Service

This is a RESTful API designed for managing products, their categories, and consumption history. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting products and categories, as well as recording product consumption history.

Check out the full details here üëâüèª [Product Catalog API README file.](https://github.com/Fawry-Project/Product-API)

and here is the ERD for the database used in this service:

```mermaid
erDiagram
PRODUCT {
    int id pk
    string code uk
    string category_id fk
    string brand_name
    string name
    string description
    double price
    string img_url
}
PRODUCT }o--|| CATEGORY : "has"
CATEGORY{
    int id pk
    string name
    string description
}

PRODUCT ||--o{ PRODUCT_CONSUMPTION :"has"
PRODUCT_CONSUMPTION{
    int id pk
    int product_code fk
    int order_code 
    int quantity_consumed
    date consumed_at
}
```

## 4. Coupons Service API
This RESTful API for managing coupons and their consumption history. It facilitates operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting coupons, as well as recording and managing coupon consumption.


Check out the [Coupons API README file.](https://github.com/Fawry-Project/Coupon-API)

and here is the ERD for the database used in this service:

```mermaid
erDiagram
COUPON ||--o{ COUPON_CONSUMPTION : "consumes"
COUPON {
    int id pk
    string code uk
    int max_number_of_usage
    int current_number_of_usage
    date expiry_date
    boolean active
    string value_type(fixed)(percentage)
    double value
}
COUPON_CONSUMPTION {
    int id pk
    string coupon_code fk
    string order_code  
    date consumed_at
}
```

## 5. Store Service
Store Service is a spring boot application designed for straightforward store inventory management. It comprises three main classes: Store, Stock, and ProductsConsumptions.

Check out the [Stores API README file.](https://github.com/Fawry-Project/Stores-Service)

and here is the ERD for the database used in this service:

```mermaid
erDiagram
STORE ||--o{ STOCK : "has"
STORE {
    int id pk
    string name
    string phone_number
    string city
}

STOCK {
    int id pk
    int product_code fk
    int store_id fk
    int quantity 
    int consumed_quantity
    date creation_date
}
```
## 6.   Admin Management and Authentication Service
This service is an admin management and authentication service built using Spring Boot, Spring Security, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It provides a secure and efficient way to manage admin users, authenticate them using email and password, and generate JWTs for accessing protected resources. Additionally, admins have the ability to add other admins and activate or deactivate their accounts.


Check out the [Admin API README file.](https://github.com/Fawry-Project/Admin-Service)

and here is the ERD for the database used in this service:

```mermaid
erDiagram
user {
        Integer id
        String firstname
        String lastname
        String email
        String password
        boolean enable
        Role role
    }
```

## 7.   Bank Management Service
This is a Spring Boot application for a banking system that provides management for user accounts, transactions, and user information. The app is built using the Spring Boot framework and a MySQL database to store banking data.


Check out the [Bank API README file.](https://github.com/Fawry-Project/Bank-API)

and here is the ERD for the database used in this service:

```mermaid
erDiagram
BANK_USER ||--o{ CARD : "has"
BANK_USER{
    int id pk
    string name
    string passward
    string email
    string phone_number
    string addrees
    string status
    string role
    date creation_date
}

CARD ||--o{ TRANSACTION : "has"
CARD {
    int id pk
    int user_id fk
    string card_number
    int csv
    double balance
    string state
    date creation_date
}

TRANSACTION{
    int id pk
    int card_id fk
    string type(deposite)(withdraw)
    int amount
    date time
}
```
